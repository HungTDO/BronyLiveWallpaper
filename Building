<strike>(version 0.2.9)</strike> (version 0.4.2)
Therefor this app should be build using Gradle.
(Gradle 1.9)

The source from the GifDecoder is included with the source from the application itself.
This is because the source has been modified.

The app also uses the OpenCSV library. The jar is included in the libs-folder.
Make sure the following is present in your gradle file:
dependencies {
    compile files ('libs/opencsv-2.3.jar')
}

Good luck building this app !
